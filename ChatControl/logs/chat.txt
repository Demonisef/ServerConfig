[09.04.2017 23:23:25] SpyJay_YT: why was i
[09.04.2017 23:23:28] SpyJay_YT: unable to talk
[09.04.2017 23:23:47] Zargon_King: somehow you edited some file and it erased your config
[09.04.2017 23:23:53] SpyJay_YT: put bungeecoord back on true? I need to test something
[09.04.2017 23:24:24] Zargon_King: I don't have ip forwarding
[09.04.2017 23:24:47] SpyJay_YT: you dont need it
[09.04.2017 23:24:48] SpyJay_YT: lol
[09.04.2017 23:25:03] Zargon_King: but I can't access my server
[09.04.2017 23:25:14] SpyJay_YT: ?
[09.04.2017 23:25:25] Zargon_King: I can't access it without ip forwarding
[09.04.2017 23:25:42] SpyJay_YT: You can't JOIN it without ip forwarding
[09.04.2017 23:25:46] SpyJay_YT: is that what u mean?
[09.04.2017 23:25:48] Zargon_King: yes
[09.04.2017 23:25:51] SpyJay_YT: because
[09.04.2017 23:26:00] SpyJay_YT: you need to join the lobby
[09.04.2017 23:26:07] SpyJay_YT: which is roleplaymc.us
[09.04.2017 23:26:14] SpyJay_YT: I said that already dude >_<
[09.04.2017 23:26:14] Zargon_King: ........
[09.04.2017 23:26:32] Zargon_King: This is my own server
[09.04.2017 23:26:45] Zargon_King: I don't want to link it up with another one
[09.04.2017 23:26:56] SpyJay_YT: I thought you agreed on that already? :(
[09.04.2017 23:27:07] Zargon_King: I want this to be unique
[09.04.2017 23:27:14] SpyJay_YT: it still can
[09.04.2017 23:27:30] Zargon_King: I want players to be able to access it via the ip I gave
[09.04.2017 23:27:37] SpyJay_YT: the only difference is that you need to join the lobby and connect through the compass
[09.04.2017 23:27:42] SpyJay_YT: come on dude
[09.04.2017 23:27:45] SpyJay_YT: I had plans for this
[09.04.2017 23:27:52] Zargon_King: alright then
[09.04.2017 23:27:54] SpyJay_YT: thats how a network works
[09.04.2017 23:27:59] Zargon_King: just this once
[09.04.2017 23:28:05] SpyJay_YT: And
[09.04.2017 23:28:15] SpyJay_YT: just tell those guys the IP is RoleplayMC.US
[09.04.2017 23:28:23] SpyJay_YT: and blue wool in the compass
[09.04.2017 23:28:32] Zargon_King: smart move though
[09.04.2017 23:28:49] Zargon_King: just try not to mute yourself again
[09.04.2017 23:28:59] SpyJay_YT: Zargon I promise I didn't touch anything
[09.04.2017 23:29:07] Zargon_King: XD alright, alright
[09.04.2017 23:29:25] Zargon_King: Ok so let's get down to some things
[09.04.2017 23:29:33] Zargon_King: I want to make ranks
[09.04.2017 23:29:39] Zargon_King: and promote users using it
[09.04.2017 23:29:47] SpyJay_YT: Zargon
